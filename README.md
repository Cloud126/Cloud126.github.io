# CSS and Bootstrap
Responsive Portfolio

## Why I did this homework

The goal of this homework is to create a web application that will render well on many different devices and screen sizes. To do this I had to make the web application
responsive by using bootstrap and @media tags.

## What I learned

Bootstrap is a very effective way to implement CSS while making the application responsive giving the deveolper more time to work on other parts of the project. Another useful tag I found was the `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`. One of the more challenging tasks was making each tab of the portfolio, responsive with them having different content. To fix this I used @media on a page to get the results I wanted for that specific content.
